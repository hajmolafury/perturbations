# perturbations
This repo is the implementation of perturbation based algorithms for training neural networks - our main interest lies in evaluating the scalability of node perturbation for hard object recognition tasks.

Master.ipynb incoperates input perturbation and node perturbation along with dynamic network creation (specify the number of hidden layers and width at runtime).
